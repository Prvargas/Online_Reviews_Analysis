1,693,2023-08-02,2,"I've been with Aetna for over a year now, and I have to say I'm incredibly disappointed with their service. The premiums are outrageously high, especially compared to other insurance providers I've researched. It feels like I'm paying a small fortune every month, yet the coverage isn't anything spectacular to justify these costs. To make matters worse, trying to get a clear explanation of what is and isn't covered is like pulling teeth. The customer service representatives seem poorly trained and are always quick to transfer my call to someone else, which only adds to the frustration. For the premium price I'm paying, I expect a much higher level of service and transparency.

Over the past year, they have made numerous changes to their policies, and none of them seem to benefit the customers. The most recent policy change increased my premiums significantly without any added benefits, making it much harder to afford.

Additionally, they have removed several key medications from their covered list, forcing me to pay out-of-pocket for essential prescriptions. Customer service is almost impossible to reach; long wait times and unhelpful representatives only add to the frustration.

Review:
I've been an Aetna customer for over two years, and my recent experience has been beyond frustrating. The appeals process is a complete nightmare! I denied coverage for a treatment that my doctor deemed necessary, so I filed an appeal. Throughout this process, Aetna's customer service has been unhelpful and dismissive. 

It took months to get a response, and when I did, it was just a generic denial with no clear explanation. I called multiple times for clarification but was repeatedly transferred between departments, each representative giving conflicting information.

993,517,2020-08-01,1,"I've been with Aetna's health insurance for the past year, and I am thoroughly disappointed. The coverage limitations are beyond frustrating. I recently needed a specific type of physical therapy my doctor recommended, only to find out Aetna wouldn't cover it due to some obscure policy exclusion. It's inexcusable to have a service that's designed to help maintain health, yet fails at the most crucial times.

The co-pays are outrageously high for the limited services that are covered. They seem to find every loophole possible to deny coverage or severely limit it. My prescriptions, which are essential for my well-being, are constantly being questioned, delayed, or denied. Their out-of-network policy is especially restrictive, making it nearly impossible to see specialists without incurring",negative,Write a negative customer review for Aetna's health insurance service.

Whether it's about coverage details, claim processing, or out-of-pocket costs, getting clear, straightforward information from them is like pulling teeth. I've spent countless hours on the phone, only to receive vague answers and misleading information. This lack of clarity has led to unexpected charges and a lot of unnecessary stress.

997,785,2023-05-31,1,"I have been incredibly disappointed with Aetna's health insurance service. The coverage limitations are utterly frustrating and make it practically impossible to get the necessary care. Firstly, they impose so many restrictions on specialists and treatments that it often feels like fighting an endless battle just to get basic medical attention. Many essential and common procedures are either not covered or require an arduous pre-approval process that delays treatment.

The worst part is the lack of transparency. They were not upfront about the limitations when I signed up, and I've had numerous unpleasant surprises when facing medical bills. Even medications that should be covered under a standard plan often end up being out-of-pocket expenses.

Customer service is no help either. When I call to dispute exorbitant charges, they transfer me from one",negative,Write a negative customer review for Aetna's health insurance service. Complain about coverage limitations.,Aetna's health insurance service

999,842,2022-03-24,1,"I recently had a very disappointing experience with Aetna's health insurance service. The primary issue was the appeals process, which turned out to be inefficient, time-consuming, and incredibly frustrating.

Firstly, I had a legitimate medical claim denied without any clear explanation. When I decided to appeal, the entire process was a mess. The forms were confusing and seemed intentionally complicated, almost as if they wanted to deter people from following through with their appeals. I spent hours gathering all the necessary documentation and filling out forms, only to find that they would constantly ask for more information or resubmit already provided documents due to ""processing errors.""
